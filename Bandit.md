## Level 0
**This is how you will access each level.**  
**ssh** has the following format {username}@{host}  
To specify a port for ssh use **-p**  

## Level 1
Find a file names readme to get the password for level 2.  
**ls** will list all directories and files in your current directory.  
**cat** will read the contents of a file and print to the terminal.  

## Level 2
Find the password in a file named **spaces in this filename**.  
**cat** does not allow spaces to be used in filenames since spaces are used to seperate arguments in terminal  
**echo** allows spaces with strings  

## Level 3
Find the password in a hidden file in the **inhere** directory.  
Read the man page for **ls**

## Level 4
Password is in only human readable file.  
Similar to level 2 you can't open a file by starting with '-' as it is used to specifiy a parameter such as -p with ssh.
